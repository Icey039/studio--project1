                Lotus root is the rhizome of most perennial aquatic plants of the family Nelumbo. The rhizome of this plant grows horizontally and is thick; the flowers float on the water surface, with oval or obovate petals; there are many stamens, yellow anthers, and radiating stigmas; the seeds grow in the "lotus pod holes," are oval, and have red or white seed coats. The flowering period is from June to September, opening in the morning and closing in the evening; the fruit ripening period is from September to October.
